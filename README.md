# Weather App

A simple static Weather App built as a single `index.html` file.  
It features a responsive design, mock weather data, and optional location detection.

## Files
- `index.html` — Main application file (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript combined).

## How to Run
Just open `index.html` in your web browser by double-clicking it or dragging it into a browser window.

## Features
- Responsive UI for mobile and desktop
- Auto-detect location (mocked, can be replaced with a real API)
- Sample weather data for Sri Lankan cities
- Minimal and modern design without external libraries

## Notes
- This is a static demo — no real API calls are made.
- To use real weather data, replace the mock function with an API call (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
